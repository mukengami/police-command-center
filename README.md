* Install [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* Go to the repository folder and install the dependencies: 
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
* Finally run Grunt 
    ```
    grunt
    ```

### Vagrant command-line interface

You can use the following commands to manage the server:

* ```vagrant up``` to initially start the server
* ```vagrant ssh``` to SSH into the running Vagrant machine
* ```vagrant reload``` reboots the server
* ```vagrant halt``` powers the server down
* ```vagrant suspend``` & ```vagrant resume``` to make the server sleep/wake up
* ```vagrant destroy``` to stop and destroy all resources of the server

More information about the Vagrant command-line interface can be found at [docs.vagrantup.com](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html).

### Secure Shell

You can use the following commands to manage the platform:

* ```police reinstall``` to re-create the sample site.

First use the Vagrant command-line interface to access the Secure Shell: ```vagrant ssh```.

### Database migrations

Database migrations are being managed using [Phpmig](https://github.com/davedevelopment/phpmig).

The Vagrant box will setup everything for you. To make sure you have applied the latest database changes, browse to ```cd scripts/phpmig``` and execute ```bin/phpmig migrate```.

To see a list of all migrations and their status, run ```bin/phpmig status```. Use the ```bin/phpmig up <migration ID>```and ```bin/phpmig down <migration ID>``` commands to apply or undo specific migrations.

For more information, please refer to the [Phpmig GitHub page](https://github.com/davedevelopment/phpmig).
